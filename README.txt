************************************************
This is a set of tools which use the GitHub API to allow LabVIEW to communicate with GitHub.

The standard LabVIEW http protocol VIs are used to communicate with the server, and three types of authentication are allowed:
1) Annonymous Calls: Allows up to 60 calls to the API per hour, limited functionality
2) Basic Authentication: Allows up 5000 calls per hour, and allows access to user specific functionality
3) Token Authentication: COMING SOON
